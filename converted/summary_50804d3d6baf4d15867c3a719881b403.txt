Kedarnath is a Hindu pilgrimage site dedicated to Shiva, and is part of the Char Dham yatra in Uttarakhand. The temple was built by the Pandava brothers according to legend, but historical evidence suggests it was rebuilt by the Acharyas under Adi Shankaracharya's guidance in the 8th century. Kedarnath was a well-known pilgrimage center by the 12th century, as mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru. The resting place of Adi Shankaracharya is believed to be near the Kedarnath mountains, although some accounts say he died in Kanchipuram.
