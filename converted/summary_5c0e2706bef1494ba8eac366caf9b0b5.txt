The lion, known as "King of the Jungle," is a powerful big cat, with males weighing up to 250 kg and females around 180 kg. Lions are social animals, living in prides, and are currently found mainly in sub-Saharan Africa and India's Gir Forest. Historically, their range has decreased due to human factors, with only two major subspecies remaining today.
